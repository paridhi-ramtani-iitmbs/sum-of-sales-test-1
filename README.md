# Overview
This is a single-page web application that fetches sales data from a CSV file, sums up the sales values, and displays the total on the page. The application uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and is fully self-contained.

# Setup
To set up the project, ensure you have the following:
- A web server to serve the `index.html` file.
- The `data.csv` file in the same directory as the `index.html`.

# Usage
1. Place the `index.html` and `data.csv` files in the same directory.
2. Run a local web server (e.g., using Python's `http.server`).
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/index.html` to view the application.

The total sales from the CSV data will be displayed on the page. The title will include a randomly generated seed.

Make sure to modify the CSV data as needed in `data.csv` to reflect your sales records.
