# Overview
This is a single-page web application that fetches sales data from a CSV file and summarizes the total sales amount. It utilizes Bootstrap 5 for styling and is designed to be simple and efficient.

# Setup
1. Ensure you have a web server running, as fetching local files directly may not work due to browser security policies.
2. Place `data.csv` in the same directory as `index.html`.

# Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The application will automatically fetch `data.csv`, calculate the total sales, and display it on the page.

The application is responsive and is styled using Bootstrap 5 to ensure a clean and modern look. The title of the page will include a random seed for uniqueness.
